# Learning about Version Control

## Recipe for a merge conflict

### Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

1. Amend README directly on github.com and put the line “Solving merge conflicts is easy!”
2. When you clone the repo, edit README and write “Solving merge conflicts is soooooo hard!”
3. Add and commit your local changes to the README, and the try to push the file so that you create the merge conflict.

This is what I like about version control: You have a record and history of all changes :smiley:
What I find most challenging: This rich history can easily become an entangled mess of branches and commits :confounded:
